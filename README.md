# QuizApp Overview and Deployment Guide

**Quiz App** is a gamification based PowerApp hosted on Microsoft Teams. It is designed to test an end user’s knowledge on Microsoft Teams, thereby facilitating learning and it also helps in providing insights to the organization on areas to drive further awareness. The quiz, pinned on Microsoft Teams, can be easily accessible from any device at any time.

It is a simple and interactive application and can be tailored for any of your internal Learning scenarios as well. The quiz is uniquely designed, in that, it randomly picks 10 questions from a large pool of questions, thereby ensuring that every user gets a unique experience.

### Step 2: Create SharePoint Lists

#### List1: QuizData (Question Bank for the quiz)
1. We will use an Excel file containing the questions to create this list. For this, download the Excel Template from the repository here - [Sample Quiz Data](https://github.com/swatiarora11/QuizApp/blob/master/Deployment/TeamsQuestionBank.xlsx). 
1. Navigate to the **Documents** document library folder in the Quiz team site and upload this excel document in the same.<p> <img src="images/image005.jpg" />
1. Open **Site Contents** on the **Quiz Team Site** and select **New >> List**.<p> <img src="images/image006.jpg" />
1. Enter the name of the List as **QuizData** and Select **From Excel** to import the list from the Excel file, saved in the **Documents** folder of the **Quiz Team Site**. Hit **Next** to continue.<p> <img src="images/image007.jpg" />
1. You will see a **Loading Tables** message on pressing **Next** and it will thereafter load the table as shown below.<p> <img src="images/image008.jpg" />
1. At this stage, we need to change the List Header fields as follows –
* Set _Option1_ to _Title_
* Set _SNo._ to _Number_
* Set _Question_ to _Multiple lines of text_.
<br><br>The columns should appear as shown below. Once you’re done with this, click **Create**.<p> <img src="images/image009.jpg" />

7. Next, we need to rename the column name **Title** to **Option1**. To do this follow the screenshot below –<p> <img src="images/image011.jpg" /><p> <img src="images/image012.jpg" />
<br>Net Result should look as shown below -<p> <img src="images/image013.jpg" />
8. Select **Option1** column and Drag & Drop the column before **Option2** for better readability of the list.<p> <img src="images/image014.jpg" />

<br>**Important Note –**
* The Time field shows the time in **seconds** format.
* The columns which show 36000 secs indicate that a user has closed / refreshed the app, while taking the quiz, hence may be disqualified. Make sure to remove these user entries by Removing Duplicates.
3. **Finding the Winner -**
<br>One of the approaches to get the winner is by using a **Custom Sort** on the final data (post removing Duplicates).<p> <img src="images/image083.jpg" />

## Quiz Data Security 
### Save Quiz List URLs
We are using following sharepoint lists of **Quiz** site for storing QuizApp data:
* QuizData - question bank for the quiz
* UserQuizData - random set of questions presented to each user and their submitted answers
* UserQuizSummary - user wise quiz summary (status, time taken and total score)

By default, sharepoint lists and libraries are visible to all organization users. In case of QuizApp, we would like to hide these lists from all users. 

But before we do that, let us open these three lists one by one from **Site Contents** section of **Quiz Site** and save their URLs to a text file. You can share these saved list URLs with administrators for quiz data management after we hide all the three lists.

### Hide Quiz Lists
Now, for hiding these lists, follow below steps -
1. Go to the **Navigation Elements** section of **Site Settings** and uncheck both **Enable Quick Launch** and **Enable Tree View** checkboxes as shown in the below snapshot.
<br><br> <img src="images/image0100.png" />
1. Download and install [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588).
1. Launch SharePoint Online Management Shell and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` command to change the execution policy. Refer this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7) for details.
1. A powershell script named [ListVisibility.ps1](https://github.com/swatiarora11/QuizApp/blob/master/Deployment/ListVisibility.ps1) has also been provided in the Deployment folder contained inside QuizApp package downloaded earlier. 
1. Using SharePoint Online Management Shell, navigate to the Deployment folder and run following commands:
`.\ListVisibility.ps1 -admin "<sp_admin_account>" -site "<quiz_site_url>" -list "QuizData" -hidden $true`
`.\ListVisibility.ps1 -admin "<sp_admin_account>" -site "<quiz_site_url>" -list "UserQuizData" -hidden $true`
`.\ListVisibility.ps1 -admin "<sp_admin_account>" -site "<quiz_site_url>" -list "UserQuizSummary" -hidden $true`
6. If above mentioned commands were executed successfully, none of the users will be able to see these lists in **Site Contents** section now. **Please note that quiz administrators can now use list urls provided to them for quiz data management.**
