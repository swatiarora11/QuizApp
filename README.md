### Step 2: Create SharePoint Lists

#### List1: Quiz Data (Question Bank for the quiz)
1. We will use an Excel file containing the questions to create this list. For this, download the Excel Template from the repository here - [Sample Quiz Data](https://github.com/swatiarora11/QuizApp/blob/master/Deployment/TeamsQuestionBank.xlsx). 
1. Navigate to the **Documents** document library folder in the Quiz team site and upload this excel document in the same.<p> <img src="images/image005.jpg" />
